# domain-randomizer
A standalone library to randomize various OpenAI Gym Environments.

[Domain Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06907) is a idea that helps with sim2real transfer, but surprisingly has no general open source implementations. This library hopes to fill in that gap by providing a _standalone_ library that you can use in your own work.
